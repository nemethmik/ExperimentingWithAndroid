# Experimenting with Android
This is a collection of experimental Android/Java phone/tablet and WearOS projects to learn various parts of Android programming including Recycler Views, Paging and others.  
On Mac the default text editor for MD files is Xcode, so I used Xcode to edit this file. In Android Studio projects I installed the Markup plugin and I added readme to each projects.
I have downloaded GitHub Desktop, either, to get more precise version control of the projects within this repository.
