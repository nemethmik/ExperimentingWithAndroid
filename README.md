# Experimenting with Android
This is a collection of experimental Android/Java phone/tablet and WearOS projects to learn various parts of Android programming including Recycler Views, Paging and others.  
On Mac the default text editor for MD files is Xcode, so I used Xcode to edit this file. In Android Studio projects I installed the Markup plugin and I added readme to each projects.
I have downloaded GitHub Desktop, either, to get more precise version control of the projects within this repository.
Instead of GitHub to monitor what AS version control does, Visual Studio Code is far better. VSC in general is far better than anything else including AS. So, I am going to use VSC along with AS to do tasks where VSC is a lot better. VSC, for example, automatically marks in the editor when you are changing source files, which sections are new, which have been modified, simply brilliant; AS looks really a stone age dead slow tool vs VSC. VSC is brilliant with Flutter. The major problem with Flutter is that it doesn't support WearOS, today. I am just working on learning the new  Paging Library from Android Architecture, and it really looks terrbly overcomplicated, totally unintuitive vs Flutter's clean architecture, honestly. Google is promoting Kotlin vs Java for native Android programming, but honestly Java is a lot cleaner language, but Google has only exemples recently for Kotlin. Flutter/Dart is a clean language, too, just like Java.
Flutter/VSC is so much more efficient than Android Studio/Java.

## RecyclerViewListItemSampleData
This is a simple project to show how to add fragment with a recycler view to a navigation graph that shows a list of items in the designer using the tools:kistitem attribute.
This was inspired by a demo made by the navigation team at [20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFGq0asqSuA&t=1217s)


## Paging Tutorial
[Paging Tutorial](https://github.com/nemethmik/ExperimentingWithAndroid/tree/master/PagingTutorial) is an AS/Java project experimenting with the new Paging Library from Android Architecture.

## Android Studio 3.4 Essentials View Model Demo (32 - 35)
This example is basically from the book Android Studio 3.4 Essentials chapters 32 - 35: [Android Jetpack ViewModel, LiveData, Data Binding, Binding Expressions in Layout XML Tutorials](https://github.com/nemethmik/ExperimentingWithAndroid/tree/master/AS34Essentials32ViewModelDemo) 

## Android Studio Essentials 3.4 (46) Card and Recycler View Demo
This example is basically from the book Android Studio 3.4 Essentials chapters 46: [Card and Recycler View Tutorial](https://github.com/nemethmik/ExperimentingWithAndroid/tree/master/AS34Essentials46CardDemo)

## Food2Fork API Tutorial
This is based on a 20-dollar video tutorial: [Retrofit, View Model, Recycler View, Live Data](https://github.com/nemethmik/ExperimentingWithAndroid/tree/master/MTFoodRecipes)
I made the majority of the project, and I modified it significantly. This architecture is a total dead end. The way to go is navigation component or Flutter. 

# WearOS is Dead
[Huawei has dropped the Wear OS](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/huawei-watch-gt-review) software it normally runs on its smartwatches, instead switching to its own OS.
This was shocking. I bought Huawei Smartwatch 2 vs the lot better Tisen-driven Samsung Gear just because of Android WearOS.
