# Paging Tutorial
This is an experimental Android/Java project to learn Recycler Views
with Paging. The initial version was started with [Belal Khan's youtube
videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh4Wq7UrTok&list=PLk7v1Z2rk4hjCQw1RVoYPRdeIzwdz5_Fi).
I have added a Markdown plugin to AS, too. The project was created with
AS, but I added this README.md manually later to make the project ok for
GitHub. When I checked before committing the files generated by AS, I
found that a JAR file Gradle wrapper is to be added. I was wondering, if
this JAR is really to be added to the GitHub repository, so I found a
page
[Understanding the Gradle Wrapper](https://medium.com/@bherbst/understanding-the-gradle-wrapper-a62f35662ab7)
which wrote "You should make sure all these are committed to version
control. They are all small, system-independent, and critical to using
the Gradle Wrapper."
