# Food Recipes 
This is a remake and follow-along project for the tutorial video of 
[REST API with MVVM and Retrofit2](https://codingwithmitch.com/courses/rest-api-mvvm-retrofit2/testing-retrofit-response-objects/)
I have made a series of summary comment videos, too:
- [Java Programming with Android Studio 3.4 05 Retrofit for Food2Fork API Module](https://youtu.be/OiPtszDrcp8)

I am maintaining an ongoing accompanying document, too, on my one drive space.
